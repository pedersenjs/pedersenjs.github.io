# Reaction to Citizen Four documentary
I found this documentary fascinating. I had never realized that Edward Snowden was just a pretty much regular guy. I found it surprising that he wasn’t even an actual NSA employee, but a contractor. This film taught me a lot about how brave and admirable he was for risking it all to share with the world the way that the US government is abusing its’ power. 
This film did change my opinion about the US government. I have grown up hearing jokes about the NSA or the FBI watching us through our cameras, and hearing about how the Patriot Act gives the government way more power to surveil its citizens than it should be allowed to have. I have also felt paranoid before that the government could just listen in on my phone calls or text messages, but I thought there was no way that they would surveil me unless I was doing anything wrong. I had not known, that those jokes and feelings had a basis in truth. I find it shocking how much information the government has collected on everyone. I think that the fact that the government allows us to know what Snowden discovered means that the US is either doing way worse than what Snowden found, and what he found was only the tip of the iceberg, or the government has so much power that people knowing what they’re doing does not even matter because no one can really stop them.
