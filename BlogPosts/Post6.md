# Blockchain
The potential impact and applications of blockchain in the future is almost infinite. Based off of the discussion that we had, I am hopeful but scared for the potential implementations. It is hard to pick the most interesting thing that I learned from our blockchain discussion, but I would probably choose the potential use of using blockchain for public record keeping and keeping important documents. I learned about how blockchain could be used for keeping track of real estate titles, or for keeping track of union membership. I think both are interesting uses that have potential to be misused, such as if a company could see union membership on a public block chain before a union had enough power, and then fire the union members before they could fully unionize.
