I found the discussion about Hive Tracks and Bee Informed to be interesting. While discussing privacy concerns that users may have with my group in class, I realized that we as developers must always consider things from our clients' perspectives. I came to this conclusion because at first, I thought that there was no reason to worry about the privacy of data related to bees, but then after thinking and imagining myself as an apiary I realized that there could be several reasons that one could want their data to be private. I also realized I need to consider more often just how much data apps collect from their users. The discussion also made me think about just how specific we can get when we use technology to create solutions to peopleâ€™s problems. Computer Science really can make a contribution to every person. I also really enjoyed the honey from Faith Mountain farms- I was actually in food lion the other day wanting to buy local honey, but I had decided against it.
