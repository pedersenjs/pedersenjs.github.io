The most important thing I learned in this class is to keep my mind open. This semester we discussed so many different aspects and applications of the field of Computer Science. Although I may think I know what I want to do now, I will remember to keep my mind open and always be expanding my horizons in order to be a great Computer Scientist. The second thing I learned is what I would find attractive in a potential employer. We had different discussions on different companies, and had some companies come to class, and this helped me learn what I like. The third most important thing I learned is to keep asking questions and stay active in discussions- since our field requires us to constantly be learning, we must stay sharp. 
My advice to students taking the class next semester is to always show up. If you don't show up, you'll miss out, and you will get less out of the class than your peers.
