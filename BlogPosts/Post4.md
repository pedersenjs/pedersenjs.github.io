# Reflections on class discussion about privacy
I am shocked by how much I learned this week just from some basic talks about privacy in a digital world. I knew that much of my data was being collected, but there are some things I never realized about it. Although I myself have used production and developer servers, and have kept old data on developer servers, I never thought about how that could affect the process of deleting a user’s data from a website or application. I was also surprised to learn just how much information is sold to Google analytics. I think it is interesting to consider ways that one can protect one’s information, and the way that protecting one’s data or being cautious about where one’s data is shared can impact the way a person can participate in modern society.
