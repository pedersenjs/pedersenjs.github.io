# What Final Presentation am I Most Interested in Hearing?
After watching all of the great topics everyone shared and hearing what they will be presenting on, I think that I am most interested in Derek's presentation. I will be taking the senior capstone class next semester so I am intrigued to learn what he completed with his time in that course. I am anxious about taking that class, so I am hoping his presentation will switch that anxiety to excitement. I also think that the concept of his app is fantastic. I find and lose things all the time, so if we could connect people better, that would be super helpful.
