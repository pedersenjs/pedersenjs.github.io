# Ethical Discussion Reflections
It was very interesting to hear everyone's thoughts about their personal ethics. This discussion has made me realize that I try to live a very calculated and black and white life when making moral decisions. I also feel that I have a more strongly developed ethical idealogy than some of my classmates, which I think is because of my life experiences. I try to make my decisions objectively and not always in my own self-interest. I found it interesting that most of the class seemed to have been raised Christian but no longer strongly identified with the religion. It also seemed like many members of the class have a different set of ethics depending on the situation, and some are okay bending their ethics when it may help them gain an advantage. Overall this was a very interesting discussion.
