## What is Snake?
The game of Snake first appeared in 1997 on the Nokia 6110. In the traditional game of snake, players move a snake around to eat apples. Each apple that is eaten causes the snake to grow longer in length. As the snake gets larger, the game grows more difficult as the player must avoid the walls confining the snake, as well as colliding the snake with itself. Both types of collisions cause the game to end.
